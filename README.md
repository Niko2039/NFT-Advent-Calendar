An NFT advent calendar is a digital advent calendar that reveals a new NFT each day in the lead up to Christmas. Here are some key details about NFT advent calendars:

NFT stands for non-fungible token. NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership of digital content like art, collectibles, music, etc.
In an NFT advent calendar, a new unique NFT is "unlocked" or revealed each day from December 1st to December 24th.
The NFTs are usually Christmas or holiday themed digital artworks, collectibles, or other content.
Some NFT advent calendars feature 24 common NFTs that anyone who purchases the calendar receives. Others feature 24 rare/unique NFTs where each calendar owner gets a different set.
The NFTs are revealed on a website or app. Calendar owners can login each day in December to see that day's NFT.
Owning the NFT advent calendar gives the rights to the NFTs inside. The NFTs can then be viewed, collected, sold, traded, etc.
NFT advent calendars are currently still quite rare. Some companies and artists are releasing them as creative alternatives to physical/chocolate advent calendars.
So in summary, it's a novel advent calendar concept for revealing unique digital NFT art or collectibles counting down to Christmas on the blockchain!
